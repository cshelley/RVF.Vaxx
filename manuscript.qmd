## Full Model

The full compartmental model for Rift Valley Fever models a two-host/two-vector system. Hosts include humans and mammals, each moving through disease progression compartments of susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I), and recovered (R). Vaccination occurs without regard to disease status, moving individuals into the $V_1$ compartment. However, vaccination does not provide full protection from infection for two weeks, and so individuals are susceptible to infection until that time, after which they move into the $V_2$ compartment. Waning immunity from natural infection and immunization is also considered in the model. Vectors include *Culex* and *Aedes* species, with adults moving from susceptible (S) to infectious (I). Susceptible adults lay non-infected eggs (P). Infectious adults may lay infected eggs (Q) or non-infected eggs (P).

***Model assumptions***. The above compartmental model diagram implies several assumptions:

1.  All human/mammalian births are susceptible; no conferred immunity.

2.  No testing before vaccination; all exposure categories vaccinated at same rate.

3.  Vaccinating exposed humans/mammals prevents conversion to infection.

4.  Waning immunity from recovery and vaccination.

5.  Adjusted birth rate for mammalian host assumes differential births due to maternal infection.

6.  Vector hatch rate is assumed to be independent of disease status.

\

The compartmental model diagram can be translated into a series of 20 ordinary differential equations (ODEs):

***Human Host***, all of the general form "change in disease status over time equals births/deaths $\pm$ disease progression $\pm$ waning immunity $\pm$ vaccination":

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dV_{H1}}{dt} &= - \mu_H V_{H1} - \beta_{AH}V_{H1} \displaystyle\left( \frac{I_A}{N_A} + \frac{I_B}{N_B}\right) - \theta_H V_{H1} + \nu_H*\nu_{takeH} (S_H + E_H + I_H + R_H) \\
\frac{dV_{H2}}{dt} &= -\mu_H V_{H2} + \theta_H V_{H2} - \rho_{VH} V_{H2} \\
\frac{dS_H}{dt} &= - \mu_H S_H + \gamma_H N_H - S_H \displaystyle\left( \beta_{AH}\frac{I_A }{N_A}+ \beta_{BH}\frac{I_B}{N_B} \displaystyle\right) + \rho_{VH} V_{H2} + \rho_{RH} V_H - \nu_H*\nu_{takeH} S_H \\
\frac{dE_H}{dt} &= - \mu_H E_H + S_H \displaystyle\left( \beta_{AH}\frac{I_A }{N_A}+ \beta_{BH}\frac{I_B}{N_B} \displaystyle\right) - \xi_H E_H - \nu_H*\nu_{takeH} E_H \\
\frac{dI_H}{dt} &= - (\mu_H + \delta_H) I_H + \xi_H E_H - \alpha_H I_H - \nu_H*\nu_{takeH} I_H \\
\frac{dR_H}{dt} &= - \mu_H R_H + \alpha_H I_H - \rho_{HR} V_H - \nu_H*\nu_{takeH} R_H
\end{aligned}
$$

***Mammalian Host***, identical to human host equations except for birth rate of (\*) = $[\gamma_1(N_M - I_M) + \gamma_2 I_M]$, which implies a differing birth rate in infected mothers not captured by disease-specific mortality and "corrected for population density to simulate removal (sales) (Sumaye 2019). Equations are of the general form "change in disease status over time equals births/deaths $\pm$ disease progression $\pm$ waning immunity $\pm$ vaccination":

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dV_{M1}}{dt} &= - \mu_M V_{M1} - \beta_{AM}V_{M1} \displaystyle\left( \frac{I_A}{N_A} + \frac{I_B}{N_B}\right) - \theta_M V_{M1} + \nu_M*\nu_{takeM} (S_M + E_M + I_M + R_M) \\
\frac{dV_{M2}}{dt} &= -\mu_M V_{M2} + \theta_M V_{M2} - \rho_{VM} V_{M2} \\
\frac{dS_M}{dt} &= - \mu_M S_M + [\gamma_1(N_M - I_M) + \gamma_2 I_M] - S_m \displaystyle\left( \beta_{AM}\frac{I_A}{N_A} + \beta_{BM}\frac{I_B}{N_B} \displaystyle\right) + \rho_{VM} V_{M2} + \rho_{RM} V_M - \nu_M*\nu_{takeM} S_M \\
\frac{dE_M}{dt} &= - \mu_M E_M + S_M \displaystyle\left( \beta_{AM}\frac{I_A}{N_A}+ \beta_{BM}\frac{I_B}{N_B} \displaystyle\right) - \xi_M E_M - \nu_M*\nu_{takeM} E_M \\
\frac{dI_M}{dt} &= - (\mu_M + \delta_M) I_M + \xi_M E_M - \alpha_M I_M - \nu_M*\nu_{takeM} I_M \\
\frac{dR_M}{dt} &= - \mu_M R_M + \alpha_M I_M - \rho_{MR} V_M - \nu_M*\nu_{takeM} R_M
\end{aligned}
$$

***Vector A***, based on Vector A of Sumaye 2019 and of the general form "change in life stage equals births (compartment P - including all births from susceptible vectors + proportion of non-vertical transmission births from infected, compartment Q - proportion of vertical transmission births from infected) - hatches - deaths" and "change in disease status equals hatches - deaths $\pm$ disease dynamics". **NOTE**: Sumaye 2019 did not model host-dependent transmission. Their disease dynamics was fully represented as $\omega_A \beta_A S_A$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dP_A}{dt} & = \gamma_A \displaystyle\left(1 - \frac{N_A}{\kappa_A} \right) \displaystyle\left[(\omega_A + \omega_{A2}^1)S_A + (1-\zeta_A) \omega_A I_A\right] - \tau_A P_A - \mu_{PA}P_A \\
\frac{dQ_A}{dt} & = \zeta_A \omega_A \displaystyle\left(1- \frac{N_A}{\kappa_A}\right) \gamma_A I_A - \tau_A Q_A - \mu_{QA}Q_A \\
\frac{dS_A}{dt} & = \tau_A P_A - \mu_{SA} S_A - \omega_A (\beta_{HA} I_H + \beta_{MA} I_M) S_A\\
\frac{dI_A}{dt} & = \tau_A Q_A - \mu_{IA} I_A + \omega_A (\beta_{HA} I_H + \beta_{MA} I_M) S_A
\end{aligned}
$$

***Vector B***, based on Vector B of Sumaye 2019, which is identical to Vector A except for the possibility of dormant eggs (***NOTE**: I can't find how they modeled that. Equations look identical to Vector A*). Equations are of the general form "change in life stage equals births (compartment P - including all births from susceptible vectors + proportion of non-vertical transmission births from infected, compartment Q - proportion of vertical transmission births from infected) - hatches - deaths" and "change in disease status equals hatches - deaths $\pm$ disease dynamics". **NOTE**: Sumaye 2019 did not model host-dependent transmission. Their disease dynamics was fully represented as $\omega_B \beta_B S_B$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dP_B}{dt} &= \gamma_B \displaystyle\left(1 - \frac{N_B}{\kappa_B} \right) \displaystyle\left[(\omega_B + \omega_{B2}^1)S_B + (1-\zeta_B) \omega_B I_B\right] - \tau_B P_B - \mu_{PB}P_B \\
\frac{dQ_B}{dt} &= \zeta_B \omega_B \displaystyle\left(1- \frac{N_B}{\kappa_B}\right) \gamma_B I_B - \tau_B Q_B - \mu_{QB}Q_B \\
\frac{dS_B}{dt} &= \tau_B P_B - \mu_{SB} S_B - \omega_B (\beta_{HB} I_H + \beta_{MB} I_M) S_B\\
\frac{dI_B}{dt} &= \tau_B Q_B - \mu_{IB} I_B + \omega_B (\beta_{HB} I_H + \beta_{MB} I_M) S_B
\end{aligned}

### Sensitivity Analysis of Simplified RVF Transmission Model

Sensitivity analysis was performed on a simplified Rift Valley Fever transmission model (Figure 2) to understand the effect of model parameters on number of human infections after 50 days of simulated transmission. The simplified model consisted of vaccinated (V), susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered (R) compartments for two host species (human, mammalian) interacting with a single vector species with compartments of uninfected egg (P), susceptible adult (S), infectious adult (I), and infected egg (Q). Births and deaths were omitted from host species but included for vectors because vector population demographics represent potentially actionable points of intervention. As in the full model, vaccination was assumed to be without regard to disease status and represented with a single parameter ($\nu$), which can be interpreted as any combination of vaccine rate $\times$ vaccine effectiveness. Waning immunity is modeled both from natural infection ($\rho_R$) and from vaccination ($\rho_V$).

#### Methodology

Sensitivity analysis was performed using the `pcc()` function from the **sensitivity** package in R. First, a Latin Hypercube sampling (LHS) of model parameter values was prepared with 5,000 samples for each parameter drawn from a uniform distribution from 0 to 1. These 5,000 sample parameter draws were then passed to the simplified RVF model function [rvf_sensitivity.R](https://github.com/cshelley/RVF.Vaxx/R/rvf_sensitivity.R) with initial conditions: (human) $S_H$ = 1000, $I_H$ = 0, $R_H$ = 0, $V_H$ = 100; (mammal) $S_M$ = 10000, $I_M$ = 20, $R_M$ = 0, $V_M$ = 100; (vector) $S_A$ = 100000, $I_A$ = 200, $P_A$ = 0, $Q_A$ = 0. The model was allowed to run for 50 time steps and the number of infected humans ($I_H$) at time = 50 was recorded. Each row of the LHS object and the corresponding number of infected humans was then passed to the `pcc()` function and partial rank correlation was performed using 1,000 bootstrap replicates and with a 95% confidence level.

Figure 3: **Partial Rank Correlation Between Human Infections and Simplified Model Parameters.** Latin hypercube sensitivity analysis was performed using partial rank correlation coefficients of simplified model parameters on the number of infected humans on Day 50 of a simulated outbreak. Parameters most negatively correlated with increased human infections (red, lefthand side), representing potential points of intervention on disease transmission, include human vaccination (ρ_H), vector egg lay rate (ω), and human infectious days (α_H). Parameters most positively correlated in red show that human vaccination rate is the parameter most correlated with increased human infections include infection rate from vector to humans (β_AH), probability of vertical transmission from adult to egg (ζ), and waning immunity from vaccine (ρ_VH)."
