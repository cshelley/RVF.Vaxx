Description: RVF.Vaxx models Rift Valley Fever transmission as a two-host/two-vector system using a deterministic compartmental approach. The model includes vaccination for both hosts without prior disease status testing, a two-week delay to vaccine protection, and waning immunity from both vaccination and natural infection.
